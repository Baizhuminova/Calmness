                   <p class="card-text">The term "mental health", as well as the synonymous concept of "psychological health", refers to the mental well-being of a person in the broad sense of the word. If a person is psychologically healthy, he can fully enjoy life, feel the meaning of his existence, cope with professional and other tasks,
                           love, work and build relationships with others.  Mental health can be disrupted for various reasons: prolonged stress, family problems, personal grief, even a traumatic brain injury can lead to such problems. They manifest themselves in different ways - from a simple decrease in self-esteem and a long period of bad mood to neuroses and even mental illness.
                         There is such a thing as psychohygiena. It includes a large set of measures that will help, if possible, avoid contacting a specialist. We must consciously approach life and the events that affect us. Choose the stress prevention methods that are suitable for you personally on our website.</p>
